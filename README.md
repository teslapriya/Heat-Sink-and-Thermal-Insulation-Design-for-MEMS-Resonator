# Heat-Sink-and-Thermal-Insulation-Design-for-MEMS-Resonator
This report provides detailed insights into the design concepts, processes, and results during the
development of the thermal management system While exploring the thermal challenges based on
space and particle requirements for resonant performance of the complexities, this project seeks to
contribute to the development of advanced space technologies which requires reliable operation of
the resonators in the situation.
